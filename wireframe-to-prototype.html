    <p> First, we had to create a wireframe that shows the layout of our website. It doesn't have to be complicated because we can decorate it later when doing the storyboard. </p>
  <h2> Wireframe </h2>
    <p> <b>Strength:</b> Simple and clear, shows and only shows the layout <p>
    <p> <b>Weakness:</b> Ugly, does not show context <p>

<img src= "Wireframe.png" height="250" width="250"/>


<p>Then, we had to create the storyboard from the wireframe. </p>
<h2> Storyboard </h2>
  <p> <b>Strength:</b> Shows the colors and pictures, can be shown for communication with client </p>
  <p> <b>Weakness:</b> Prettier and more presentable than the wireframe </p>

<h2>Here are the homepages I've made:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="finalhtmldocs/index-fw.htm">Fireworks Version</a></li>
  <li><a href="finalhtmldocs/index-dw.html">Dreamweaver Version</a></li>
</ul>

<h2> Fireworks </h2>
  <p> <b> Strength: </b> More flexible in terms of movement of images (you can easily drag to its wanted place) </p>
  <p> <b> Weakness: </b> Less flexible in terms of CSS and additional features </p>

<h2> Dreamweaver </h2>
  <p> <b>Strength:</b> It has a 'split' function where you can view your html along with the visual.
  <p> <b>Weakness:</b> It is more time consuming in terms of placing the images and getting them in the right spots.</p>
