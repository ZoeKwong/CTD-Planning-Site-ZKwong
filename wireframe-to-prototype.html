    <h1> Homepage Made in Fireworks </h1>

    <p> First, we had to create a wireframe that shows the layout of our website. It doesn't have to be complicated because we can decorate it later when doing the storyboard. </p>
  <h2> Wireframe </h2>
    <p> <b>Strengths:</b> Simple and clear, shows and only shows the layout <p>
    <p> <b>Weakness:</b> Ugly, does not show context <p>

<p>Then, we had to create the storyboard from the wireframe. </p>
<h2> Storyboard </h2>
  <p> <b>Strengths:</b> Shows the colors and pictures, can be shown for communication with client </p>
  <p> <b>Weakness:</b> Prettier and more presentable than the wireframe </p>
